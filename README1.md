# My Gatsby Portfolio Site

Welcome to my Gatsby Portfolio Site! This is a personal portfolio website built with Gatsby, designed to showcase my projects, artworks, and skills. It leverages the power of Gatsby for fast rendering and beautiful image optimization.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (14.15.0 or later)
- npm

  You can check your Node.js and npm versions by running:

  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/el-riber/web20.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-gatsby-app
   ```

3. Install NPM packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   gatsby develop
   ```

5. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to view the site.

## Usage

After launching the development server, you can start editing the files to add your content. For example, you can modify `src/pages/index.js` to change the homepage content.

## Deployment

To build your site for production, run:

```bash
gatsby build
```

This generates a `public` directory with all static files needed for your site. You can deploy this directory to any static site hosting provider like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
